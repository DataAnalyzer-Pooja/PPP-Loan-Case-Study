# PPP-Loan-Case-Study
This project aims to provide insights on loans provided by U.S. Government during the Coronovirus Pandemic in 2020-2021. 

Welcome to the PPP Loan data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja. 

# Introduction 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a $953-billion business loan program established by the United States federal government in 2020 through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to help certain businesses, self-employed workers, sole proprietors, certain nonprofit organizations and tribal businesses continue paying their workers. The PPP allows entities to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll and certain other costs.

# Business Task
To conduct a data analysis on PPP loans provided by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The analysis should include both statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the distribution and impact of the loans on small businesses.
Following questions needed to be answered by the analysis:-
- What industries received the most PPP loans?
- What was the distribution of loan amounts among different businesses?
- How did the amount of PPP loans vary by state or region?
- Which all lenders provided the most PPP loan amount?
- What was the yearly average loan size for businesses?
- How did the forgiven amount of PPP loans vary by the approved amount of the loan?

# Deliverables
The project includes the following:-
- Datasource of all the input CSV files: [Data Dictionary](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia), [PPP loan data](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia) and [NAICS Size Standards data](https://www.sba.gov/document/support-table-size-standards)
- A SQL [code file](https://github.com/DataAnalyzer-Pooja/PPP-Loan-Case-Study/blob/main/SQL_Queries_Case_Study_PPP.sql) containing the cleaning and explorartoy data analysis using SQL. 
- A SQL [code file](https://github.com/DataAnalyzer-Pooja/PPP-Loan-Case-Study/blob/main/SQL_View_Case_Study_PPP.sql) of VIEW created using SQL.
- PPP Loan analysis [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pooja1749/viz/PPPAnalysisDashboard/PPPSummary) using TABLEAU. 

I hope this project helps you understand the PPP loan data and the impact of the program on small businesses. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
